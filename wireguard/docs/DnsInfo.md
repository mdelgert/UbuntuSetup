### Key Points
- You're using Ubuntu 24.04.2 on both a Desktop and Server installation, with an OpenVPN setup on an Asus router (LAN: `192.168.50.0/24`, VPN: `192.168.100.0/24`, DNS server: `192.168.50.1`).
- On Ubuntu Desktop, you experienced a DNS resolution issue where `nslookup b1.local` resolved to `192.168.50.241`, but `ssh b1.local` failed with `Could not resolve hostname b1.local: Name or service not known`. This issue was absent on Ubuntu Server.
- You identified a difference in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`:
  - **Ubuntu Server**: `hosts: files dns`
  - **Ubuntu Desktop**: `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`
- The issue likely stems from the `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]` entry in Ubuntu Desktop’s `nsswitch.conf`, which affects how hostnames (especially `.local`) are resolved, causing SSH to fail despite `systemd-resolved` working correctly.
- Both systems run Ubuntu 24.04, so the difference is due to Desktop vs. Server edition configurations, particularly the inclusion of Avahi (mDNS) on Desktop.

### Direct Answer

**What Ubuntu Desktop is Doing with `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`**  
The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file defines the order and methods for resolving hostnames in Ubuntu, used by the Name Service Switch (NSS) library (`getaddrinfo`, called by SSH). The `hosts` line specifies how hostname lookups are performed:

- **Ubuntu Server**: `hosts: files dns`
  - **Files**: Checks `/etc/hosts` first for static hostname mappings.
  - **DNS**: Queries the DNS resolver (e.g., `systemd-resolved` via `127.0.0.53`, which forwards to `192.168.50.1` for `b1.local`).
  - **Behavior**: Simple and direct. For `b1.local`, it checks `/etc/hosts`, then queries `systemd-resolved`, which resolves to `192.168.50.241` via the router’s `dnsmasq`. This worked for SSH on the Server.

- **Ubuntu Desktop**: `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`
  - **Files**: Checks `/etc/hosts` first.
  - **mdns4_minimal**: Uses the Avahi daemon (`libnss-mdns`) for multicast DNS (mDNS) to resolve `.local` hostnames on the local network via UDP port 5353. `mdns4_minimal` supports IPv4 only and is optimized for minimal mDNS queries.
  - **[NOTFOUND=return]**: If `mdns4_minimal` returns `NOTFOUND` for a `.local` hostname (e.g., `b1.local`), the lookup stops, and the `dns` method is not tried. This is critical for your issue.
  - **DNS**: Queries `systemd-resolved` (only if `mdns4_minimal` doesn’t return `NOTFOUND`).
  - **Behavior**: For `b1.local`, NSS first checks `/etc/hosts`. If not found, it queries Avahi via `mdns4_minimal`. Since `b1.local` is resolved by the router’s `dnsmasq` (not mDNS on the local network), Avahi likely returns `NOTFOUND`, and `[NOTFOUND=return]` halts the lookup, preventing `systemd-resolved` from querying `192.168.50.1`. This causes `ssh b1.local` to fail, even though `nslookup b1.local` works (as `nslookup` bypasses NSS and directly queries `systemd-resolved`).

**Why This Happens on Ubuntu Desktop but Not Server**  
- **Ubuntu Desktop (24.04)**: Includes Avahi (`avahi-daemon`) by default for zero-configuration networking, enabling mDNS for `.local` domains (common in GUI environments for device discovery, e.g., printers). The `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]` in `nsswitch.conf` prioritizes mDNS for `.local` and stops at `NOTFOUND` to avoid DNS conflicts, as mDNS assumes `.local` is reserved for multicast (per RFC 6762).
- **Ubuntu Server (24.04)**: Does not install Avahi by default, focusing on minimal dependencies. The `hosts: files dns` configuration uses only `/etc/hosts` and `systemd-resolved`, allowing `b1.local` to resolve via the router’s `dnsmasq` without mDNS interference.
- **Same Version (24.04)**: The difference arises from Desktop’s inclusion of Avahi and its NSS configuration, tailored for user-friendly networking, versus Server’s lean setup.

**Why SSH Fails on Desktop**  
- SSH uses `getaddrinfo` (NSS) for hostname resolution, following `nsswitch.conf`. On Desktop, `b1.local` triggers `mdns4_minimal`, which fails (as `b1.local` is not an mDNS hostname on the local network), and `[NOTFOUND=return]` stops the lookup before reaching `systemd-resolved`’s DNS (which would resolve it via `192.168.50.1`).
- `nslookup` bypasses NSS, directly querying `systemd-resolved`’s stub (`127.0.0.53`), which explains why it works.
- On Server, NSS goes straight to `dns` after `files`, allowing `systemd-resolved` to resolve `b1.local` correctly.

**Manual Steps to Fix on Ubuntu Desktop**  
To make Ubuntu Desktop behave like Server for SSH resolution, modify `nsswitch.conf` to bypass `mdns4_minimal` or adjust mDNS handling. Below are steps to fix the issue, verify SSH, and undo changes, tailored to your OpenVPN setup and the built-in VPN client (NetworkManager).

1. **Modify nsswitch.conf to Match Server**  
   Remove `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]` to use `files dns` like Ubuntu Server.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Change:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```
     to:
     ```
     hosts: files dns
     ```
     Save and exit.
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Test:
     ```bash
     getent hosts b1.local
     ssh b1.local
     ```
     Expected: `getent` returns `192.168.50.241 b1.local`, and SSH connects.
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Restore:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```

2. **Adjust nsswitch.conf to Allow DNS Fallback**  
   Keep `mdns4_minimal` but remove `[NOTFOUND=return]` to allow DNS lookup if mDNS fails.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Change:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```
     to:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns
     ```
     Save and exit.
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     getent hosts b1.local
     ssh b1.local
     ```
     If mDNS fails for `b1.local`, it should fall back to `systemd-resolved` and resolve via `192.168.50.1`.
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Restore:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```

3. **Disable Avahi Daemon**  
   Disable Avahi to prevent mDNS interference entirely.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon
     sudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     systemctl status avahi-daemon
     ```
     Confirm it’s stopped. Test:
     ```bash
     getent hosts b1.local
     ssh b1.local
     ```
     With Avahi disabled, NSS should skip `mdns4_minimal` and use `dns`.
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon
     sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon
     ```

4. **Fix ~/.ssh/config to Bypass NSS**  
   If modifying `nsswitch.conf` is undesirable, adjust `~/.ssh/config` to use the IP directly.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/config
     ```
     Check for:
     ```
     Host b1.local
         HostName b1.local
         User <username>
     ```
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/config
     ```
     Change to:
     ```
     Host b1.local
         HostName 192.168.50.241
         User <username>
     ```
     Save and set permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     ssh -v b1.local
     ```
     If it connects, the NSS issue is bypassed.
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/config
     ```
     Revert to:
     ```
     Host b1.local
         HostName b1.local
         User <username>
     ```

5. **Ensure NetworkManager Applies DNS Settings**  
   Verify NetworkManager propagates `local` to `systemd-resolved`.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection show <vpn-name> | grep dns
     ```
     Find `<vpn-name>`:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection show
     ```
     Expected: `ipv4.dns: 192.168.50.1`, `ipv4.dns-search: local`.
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns 192.168.50.1
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search local
     nmcli connection up <vpn-name>
     ```
     Ensure NetworkManager uses `systemd-resolved`:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
     ```
     Add under `[main]`:
     ```
     dns=systemd-resolved
     ```
     Restart:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     resolvectl status tun0
     cat /etc/resolv.conf
     ```
     Confirm `search local` in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
     Test:
     ```bash
     ssh b1.local
     ```
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns ""
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search ""
     sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf  # Remove dns=systemd-resolved
     sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
     nmcli connection up <vpn-name>
     ```

**Testing After Each Step**  
Test:
```bash
getent hosts b1.local
ssh b1.local
```
If SSH connects, note the step (likely 1, 2, or 4). If it fails, proceed to the next step.

**Reverting All Changes**  
To undo all changes:
- **Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf  # Restore hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
  sudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon  # If step 3 used
  sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon
  nano ~/.ssh/config  # Revert b1.local to HostName b1.local
  nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns ""
  nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search ""
  sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf  # Remove dns=systemd-resolved
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
  nmcli connection up <vpn-name>
  ```
- **Verify**:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
  resolvectl status tun0
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  ```
  Expect `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`, `DNS Servers: 192.168.50.1`, `DNS Domain: ~local`, and `search .` in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

**Why the Difference Between Desktop and Server**  
The `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]` in Ubuntu Desktop’s `nsswitch.conf` is a deliberate design choice to support mDNS for `.local` domains, as Avahi is installed by default. This conflicts with your router’s use of `.local` for DNS (via `dnsmasq`), causing NSS to stop at `NOTFOUND` before reaching `systemd-resolved`. Ubuntu Server’s simpler `files dns` avoids this, allowing SSH to resolve `b1.local` via `systemd-resolved` and the router’s DNS.

**Automating the Solution**  
If step 1 or 2 fixes SSH, consider:
- **Persistent nsswitch.conf**: Keep `hosts: files dns` or `hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns` by editing `/etc/nsswitch.conf` permanently.
- **NetworkManager**: Ensure `ipv4.dns-search local`:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search local
  ```
- **update-systemd-resolved**: If switching to command-line OpenVPN:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install openvpn
  sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonathanio/update-systemd-resolved/master/update-systemd-resolved -O /etc/openvpn/scripts/update-systemd-resolved
  sudo chmod +x /etc/openvpn/scripts/update-systemd-resolved
  sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client.ovpn
  ```
  Add:
  ```
  script-security 2
  up /etc/openvpn/scripts/update-systemd-resolved
  down /etc/openvpn/scripts/update-systemd-resolved
  down-pre
  dhcp-option DNS 192.168.50.1
  dhcp-option DOMAIN local
  ```
  Start:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start openvpn@client
  ```

**Next Steps If It Fails**  
If SSH still fails, provide:
- Full `~/.ssh/config` content.
- Output of `nmcli connection show <vpn-name>`.
- Output of `getent hosts b1.local` after each step.
- Output of `ssh -v 192.168.50.241` (to test IP-based connection).
- Output of `journalctl -u NetworkManager | grep dns`.
- Confirmation of Avahi status: `systemctl status avahi-daemon`.
- Router model and firmware version.
This will help diagnose NetworkManager, Avahi, or SSH-specific issues.

**Conclusion**  
The `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]` in Ubuntu Desktop’s `nsswitch.conf` causes SSH to fail resolving `b1.local` by stopping at mDNS before reaching `systemd-resolved`, unlike Server’s `files dns`. Modifying `nsswitch.conf` or bypassing mDNS should fix it. The built-in VPN client’s DNS handling exacerbates the issue, but steps to adjust NetworkManager or switch to command-line OpenVPN can resolve it. All steps are reversible, and automation can follow success.

### Key Points
- You're using Ubuntu 24.04.2 Desktop with an OpenVPN setup on an Asus router (LAN: `192.168.50.0/24`, VPN: `192.168.100.0/24`, DNS server: `192.168.50.1`). You’ve identified a DNS resolution issue where `nslookup b1.local` resolves to `192.168.50.241`, but `ssh b1.local` fails due to the `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns` line in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.
- The issue stems from `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]`, which stops hostname resolution for `.local` domains (like `b1.local`) at mDNS if Avahi returns `NOTFOUND`, preventing `systemd-resolved` from querying the router’s DNS (`192.168.50.1`).
- You propose replacing:
  ```
  hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
  ```
  with:
  ```
  hosts: files dns mdns4
  ```
- This change was successful on Ubuntu Server (`hosts: files dns`), but you want to understand what issues or breakage might occur on Ubuntu Desktop by making this change.

### Direct Answer

**What the Proposed Change Does**  
The `hosts` line in `/etc/nsswitch.conf` determines the order and methods the Name Service Switch (NSS) uses to resolve hostnames (via `getaddrinfo`, used by SSH, etc.). The proposed change modifies the resolution process:

- **Current (`hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns`)**:
  - **Files**: Checks `/etc/hosts` first.
  - **mdns4_minimal**: Queries Avahi’s mDNS for `.local` hostnames (IPv4 only, minimal mode). If Avahi returns `NOTFOUND` for a `.local` hostname (e.g., `b1.local`), the `[NOTFOUND=return]` directive stops resolution, and `dns` is not tried.
  - **DNS**: Queries `systemd-resolved` (via `127.0.0.53`, forwarding to `192.168.50.1`) only if mDNS doesn’t return `NOTFOUND`.

- **Proposed (`hosts: files dns mdns4`)**:
  - **Files**: Checks `/etc/hosts` first.
  - **DNS**: Queries `systemd-resolved`, which forwards to `192.168.50.1` for `b1.local`, resolving to `192.168.50.241`.
  - **mdns4**: Queries Avahi’s mDNS for all hostnames (not just `.local`, unlike `mdns4_minimal`), but only after DNS. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (less restrictive than `mdns4_minimal`).
  - **Effect**: For `b1.local`, NSS checks `/etc/hosts`, then `systemd-resolved` (which succeeds), and only tries mDNS if DNS fails. This avoids the `[NOTFOUND=return]` issue, allowing SSH to resolve `b1.local`.

**What Will This Break?**  
The change prioritizes DNS over mDNS and uses `mdns4` instead of `mdns4_minimal`, which could affect Ubuntu Desktop’s zero-configuration networking. Potential issues include:

1. **Delayed or Failed mDNS Resolution**:
   - **Impact**: Devices or services relying on mDNS for `.local` hostnames (e.g., printers, Chromecasts, or Bonjour-enabled devices) may resolve more slowly or fail if DNS takes precedence and returns a result (or error) before mDNS. `mdns4` is queried last, unlike `mdns4_minimal`, which is prioritized for `.local`.
   - **Example**: A printer at `printer.local` might not resolve if `systemd-resolved` returns `NXDOMAIN` first, whereas `mdns4_minimal` would have tried mDNS earlier.
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate. Most home networks rely on mDNS for `.local` discovery, and Desktop’s Avahi is optimized for this. If your network has mDNS-dependent devices, you may notice issues.
   - **Mitigation**: Test mDNS devices (e.g., `ping printer.local`) after the change. If needed, revert or use `hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns` (step 2 below).

2. **Increased mDNS Traffic**:
   - **Impact**: `mdns4` (unlike `mdns4_minimal`) resolves all hostnames via mDNS, not just `.local`, and supports IPv6. This could increase network traffic or resolver load, especially in busy networks with many mDNS devices.
   - **Likelihood**: Low. Most home networks have limited mDNS activity, and the impact is minimal unless you have a large number of devices.
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor network performance or revert to `mdns4_minimal` if issues arise.

3. **Compatibility with Avahi-Dependent Applications**:
   - **Impact**: GUI applications (e.g., file sharing, media players) that expect fast `.local` resolution via Avahi may behave unexpectedly if DNS overrides mDNS. For example, a music streaming app might fail to find a `.local` speaker.
   - **Likelihood**: Low to Moderate. Depends on your use of mDNS-based apps. Common Desktop apps (e.g., GNOME Files) may be affected if they rely on Avahi.
   - **Mitigation**: Test apps like GNOME Files or Rhythmbox for network device discovery. Consider `hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns` to retain mDNS priority.

4. **Potential DNS Conflicts**:
   - **Impact**: If your network has both DNS and mDNS resolving the same hostname (e.g., `device.local` defined in both `dnsmasq` and Avahi), prioritizing DNS might lead to unexpected results (e.g., resolving to the wrong IP).
   - **Likelihood**: Low. Your router uses `.local` for DNS, and Avahi is unlikely to conflict unless you have local devices broadcasting the same `.local` names.
   - **Mitigation**: Check for conflicts with `avahi-browse -a` to list mDNS devices. Use `nslookup device.local 192.168.50.1` to compare DNS results.

5. **Loss of mDNS-Only Features**:
   - **Impact**: Some mDNS-only services (e.g., Apple AirPlay, certain IoT devices) may not resolve correctly if DNS takes precedence, as they rely on mDNS broadcasts not intercepted by DNS.
   - **Likelihood**: Low. Most modern devices support fallback to DNS, but niche or older devices may be affected.
   - **Mitigation**: Test specific mDNS services (e.g., `avahi-resolve -n device.local`). Revert if critical devices fail.

**Other Potential Issues**  
- **GUI Network Discovery**: Ubuntu Desktop’s Nautilus or GNOME Settings may show fewer devices in “Network” if mDNS is deprioritized, affecting user experience.
- **Performance**: DNS queries to `192.168.50.1` over the VPN may be slower than local mDNS, though this is negligible in your setup.
- **Future Updates**: Ubuntu Desktop updates might overwrite `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, restoring `mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return]`. You’d need to reapply the change or make it persistent (e.g., via a custom NSS configuration).

**Will This Fix the SSH Issue?**  
Yes, replacing `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns` with `hosts: files dns mdns4` should fix `ssh b1.local`. By prioritizing `dns`, NSS will query `systemd-resolved` (which resolves `b1.local` to `192.168.50.241` via `192.168.50.1`) before mDNS, bypassing the `[NOTFOUND=return]` block. This mimics Ubuntu Server’s behavior, where SSH works.

**Manual Steps to Apply and Verify**  
Below are steps to implement the change, verify SSH resolution, and mitigate potential issues, with undo instructions.

1. **Modify nsswitch.conf**  
   Update `nsswitch.conf` to use the proposed configuration.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Change:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```
     to:
     ```
     hosts: files dns mdns4
     ```
     Save and exit.
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Test:
     ```bash
     getent hosts b1.local
     ssh b1.local
     ```
     Expected: `getent` returns `192.168.50.241 b1.local`, and SSH connects.
     Test mDNS devices:
     ```bash
     ping printer.local  # Replace with your device
     avahi-browse -a  # List mDNS devices
     ```
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Restore:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```

2. **Alternative: Keep mDNS with Fallback**  
   If mDNS devices are critical, try allowing DNS fallback without `[NOTFOUND=return]`.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Change:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
     ```
     to:
     ```
     hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns
     ```
     Save and exit.
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     getent hosts b1.local
     ssh b1.local
     ping printer.local
     ```
     If SSH works and mDNS devices resolve, this balances both needs.
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
     ```
     Restore original line.

3. **Test NetworkManager DNS Settings**  
   Ensure NetworkManager applies the `local` search domain to avoid `search .` in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection show <vpn-name> | grep dns
     ```
     Find `<vpn-name>`:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection show
     ```
     Expected: `ipv4.dns: 192.168.50.1`, `ipv4.dns-search: local`.
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns 192.168.50.1
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search local
     nmcli connection up <vpn-name>
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/resolv.conf
     ```
     Confirm `search local`.
     Test:
     ```bash
     ssh b1.local
     ```
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns ""
     nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search ""
     nmcli connection up <vpn-name>
     ```

4. **Check ~/.ssh/config**  
   Ensure `~/.ssh/config` isn’t interfering, as it has a `b1.local` entry.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/config
     ```
     Check for:
     ```
     Host b1.local
         HostName b1.local
         User <username>
     ```
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/config
     ```
     Change to:
     ```
     Host b1.local
         HostName 192.168.50.241
         User <username>
     ```
     Save and set permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     ```bash
     ssh -v b1.local
     ```
   - **Undo**:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/config
     ```
     Revert to original.

**Testing After Each Step**  
Test:
```bash
getent hosts b1.local
ssh b1.local
```
Test mDNS:
```bash
ping printer.local  # Replace with your device
avahi-browse -a
```
If SSH and mDNS work, the change is successful.

**Reverting All Changes**  
To undo:
- **Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf  # Restore hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
  nano ~/.ssh/config  # Revert b1.local to HostName b1.local
  nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns ""
  nmcli connection modify <vpn-name> ipv4.dns-search ""
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
  nmcli connection up <vpn-name>
  ```
- **Verify**:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
  resolvectl status tun0
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  ```

**Mitigating Potential Issues**  
- **Monitor mDNS Devices**: After changing to `hosts: files dns mdns4`, test devices like printers or media servers. If they fail, use `hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns` (step 2) or re-enable `[NOTFOUND=return]` and use `~/.ssh/config` (step 4).
- **Persistent Configuration**: To prevent Ubuntu updates from overwriting `nsswitch.conf`, create a custom NSS file:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/nsswitch.d
  sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.d/hosts.conf
  ```
  Add:
  ```
  hosts: files dns mdns4
  ```
  Update `nsswitch.conf` to include:
  ```
  include /etc/nsswitch.d/hosts.conf
  ```
- **Alternative**: If mDNS is rarely used, disable Avahi:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon
  sudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon
  ```
  Undo:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon
  sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon
  ```

**Next Steps If Issues Arise**  
If SSH works but mDNS devices fail, or if SSH still fails, provide:
- Output of `getent hosts b1.local` and `getent hosts printer.local` (for an mDNS device).
- Output of `avahi-browse -a`.
- Full `~/.ssh/config` content.
- Output of `nmcli connection show <vpn-name>`.
- Output of `ssh -v 192.168.50.241`.
- Router model and firmware version.
This will help diagnose mDNS conflicts or persistent SSH issues.

**Conclusion**  
Replacing `hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns` with `hosts: files dns mdns4` should fix `ssh b1.local` by prioritizing `systemd-resolved` over mDNS, but it may delay or break mDNS resolution for `.local` devices like printers. The main risks are slower mDNS device discovery or conflicts in busy networks, which can be mitigated by testing and using alternatives like `hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns` or `~/.ssh/config`. All steps are reversible, ensuring you can restore the original Desktop behavior if needed.
