### ‚úÖ WireGuard Port Details

* **Default Port**: `51820`
* **Protocol**: **UDP only**
* **TCP is not supported** by WireGuard.

---

### üîß Should You Change the Port?

**Usually no**, unless:

* Your ISP or mobile network blocks uncommon ports like 51820.
* You want to obscure the VPN by running on a common port like 443 or 53 (obfuscation, not security).
* You're already using 51820 on another server.

If you have no specific reason, it's best to **leave it as `51820/udp`**.

---

### üåê Do You Need to Open Ports with Your ISP?

* **If your ASUS GT-AX11000 Pro has a public IP on the WAN interface**:
  ‚úÖ You only need to allow/forward **UDP 51820** on your **router**.

* **If you're behind CG-NAT or double NAT (common with 5G/home ISP routers)**:
  ‚ùå You **can't port forward** from your ASUS router unless the upstream modem/router is also configured to forward UDP 51820 to your ASUS WAN IP.

To check your public IP:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

Then log in to your ASUS router and look at the WAN IP in the web GUI.

* If it **matches**: ‚úÖ you have a public IP.
* If it‚Äôs something like `100.x.x.x` or `192.168.x.x`: ‚ùå you're behind CG-NAT or double NAT.
