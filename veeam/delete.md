To delete and clear all backups created by the Veeam Agent for Linux, you need to carefully remove both the backup files from the storage location and the associated records from the Veeam Agent database. Below are the steps to accomplish this, based on the Veeam Agent for Linux documentation. Be cautious, as these actions are irreversible and will permanently delete all backup data.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Stop Any Running Backup Jobs**  
   Ensure no backup jobs are currently running, as this could cause issues during deletion. You can check and stop jobs using the Veeam Agent control panel or command line:
   - **Control Panel**: Run `veeam` or `veeamconfig ui` to open the Veeam Agent control panel. Check for running jobs and stop them if necessary.
   - **Command Line**: List running jobs with `veeamconfig job list` and stop a job with `veeamconfig job stop --id <job_id>`.

2. **Identify Backup Locations**  
   Determine where your backups are stored (e.g., local directory, network shared folder, or Veeam Backup & Replication repository). You can find this information in the backup job settings:
   - Use the command `veeamconfig job info --id <job_id>` to view job details, including the target repository.
   - Alternatively, check the Veeam Agent control panel for job configurations.

3. **Delete Backup Records from Veeam Agent Database**  
   Use the `veeamconfig` command to remove records of backups from the Veeam Agent database. This step removes metadata about the backups but may leave the actual files on the storage, depending on the repository type.
   - List all backups:  
     ```bash
     veeamconfig backup list
     ```
     This will display a list of backups with their IDs.
   - Delete each backup record:  
     ```bash
     veeamconfig backup delete --id <backup_id>
     ```
     Replace `<backup_id>` with the ID of each backup from the list. Repeat for all backups.
   - **Note**: If backups are stored in a local directory or network shared folder, this command removes only the database records, leaving the backup files (VBK, VIB, VBM) on the storage. If backups are in a Veeam Backup & Replication repository, this also removes records from the Veeam Backup & Replication database but leaves files intact.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_delete.html)[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_delete.html?ver=60)

4. **Manually Delete Backup Files from Storage**  
   To completely clear all backup files, manually delete them from the storage location:
   - Navigate to the backup repository (e.g., a local folder like `/backup` or a network share).
   - Identify the backup files, which typically have extensions `.vbk` (full backup), `.vib` (incremental backup), and `.vbm` (metadata).
   - Delete the entire backup chain (all VBK, VIB, and VBM files) to avoid issues with future backups:
     ```bash
     rm -rf /path/to/backup/*
     ```
     Replace `/path/to/backup` with the actual path to your backup repository.
   - **Warning**: Be certain you’re deleting the correct files, as this action cannot be undone. If the repository is shared with other backups, ensure you only delete files related to the Veeam Agent for Linux.

5. **Rescan the Repository (Optional)**  
   After manually deleting files, rescan the repository to update the Veeam Agent database and ensure it no longer references deleted backups:
   ```bash
   veeamconfig repository rescan --all
   ```
   This command checks all configured repositories and updates the database to reflect the current state of the storage.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_delete.html)

6. **Delete Backup Jobs (Optional)**  
   If you no longer need the backup jobs, you can delete them to prevent future backups from running:
   - **Control Panel**:  
     - Run `veeam` or `veeamconfig ui`.
     - Press `C` to configure jobs or `S` to start jobs, select the job, and press `Delete`. Confirm by pressing `Enter` on the `Yes` button.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_job_delete.html)
   - **Command Line**:  
     - List jobs: `veeamconfig job list`
     - Delete a job: `veeamconfig job delete --id <job_id>`
   - Deleting a job does not affect existing backup files; it only removes the job configuration.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_job_delete.html)

7. **Verify Cleanup**  
   - Confirm that no backups are listed:  
     ```bash
     veeamconfig backup list
     ```
     The list should be empty.
   - Check the storage location to ensure all backup files are removed.
   - If using a Veeam Backup & Replication repository, verify with the backup administrator that records are removed from the Veeam Backup & Replication console.

8. **Handle Veeam Backup & Replication Repositories (If Applicable)**  
   If backups were stored in a Veeam Backup & Replication repository, the `veeamconfig backup delete` command removes records from both the Veeam Agent and Veeam Backup & Replication databases, but files remain on the repository. To delete these files:
   - Use the Veeam Backup & Replication console:
     - Open the **Home** view, navigate to **Backups**, and select the relevant backup.
     - Right-click and choose **Delete from disk** to remove both records and files.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/agents/agent_backup_delete.html)
   - Alternatively, contact the backup administrator to perform this action, as you may not have direct access.

9. **Clean Up Configuration (Optional)**  
   If you want to completely reset the Veeam Agent for Linux configuration (e.g., for a fresh start), uninstall and purge the agent:
   - Uninstall and purge configuration:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get purge veeam veeamsnap
     ```
     This removes the agent and its configuration files, including the database.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veeam/comments/pzfx6l/how_to_fully_reinstall_veeam_agent_for_linux/)
   - Reinstall the agent if needed:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install veeam
     ```
   - After reinstalling, you’ll need to reconfigure backup jobs from scratch.

### Important Notes
- **Retention Policy**: Normally, Veeam Agent removes backups automatically based on the retention policy. If you’re clearing backups due to excessive retention, consider adjusting the retention settings in the job configuration to prevent future issues.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_delete.html)
- **Immutability**: If backups are stored in a repository with immutability enabled (e.g., hardened Linux repository or cloud storage with immutability), you cannot delete files until the immutability period expires. Check with your administrator or repository settings.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vac/provider_admin/remove_agent_job.html)
- **Veeam Backup & Replication**: If backups are managed by Veeam Backup & Replication, some operations (e.g., deleting files from the repository) require access to the Veeam Backup & Replication console. Coordinate with the backup administrator if needed.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/integraton_remove_backups.html)
- **Risk of Data Loss**: Manually deleting files or records can disrupt restore capabilities if not done correctly. Always ensure you’re targeting the correct backups and have no need for the data before proceeding.
- **Documentation Reference**: For detailed command syntax and additional options, refer to the Veeam Agent for Linux User Guide, particularly the sections on deleting backups and backup jobs.[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_delete.html)[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_job_delete.html)[](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/agentforlinux/userguide/backup_delete.html?ver=60)

### Example Workflow
Assume backups are stored in `/backup/veeam` and you have one job configured:
1. Stop the job:  
   ```bash
   veeamconfig job list
   veeamconfig job stop --id <job_id>
   ```
2. List and delete backup records:  
   ```bash
   veeamconfig backup list
   veeamconfig backup delete --id <backup_id>
   ```
3. Delete files:  
   ```bash
   rm -rf /backup/veeam/*
   ```
4. Rescan repository:  
   ```bash
   veeamconfig repository rescan --all
   ```
5. Delete the job:  
   ```bash
   veeamconfig job delete --id <job_id>
   ```
6. Verify:  
   ```bash
   veeamconfig backup list
   ls /backup/veeam
   ```

### If Issues Persist
- If backups still appear in the Veeam Agent control panel after deletion, ensure you’ve rescanned the repository and removed all files.
- If you encounter errors with `veeamconfig` commands, run them with `sudo` to ensure proper permissions.
- For complex setups (e.g., Veeam Backup & Replication integration), consult the Veeam support team or your backup administrator, providing details like your Veeam Agent version and repository type.

By following these steps, you should be able to fully delete and clear all backups created by the Veeam Agent for Linux. If you need further assistance or have a specific setup (e.g., cloud repository), let me know, and I can tailor the instructions!
