### Unsupported Kernel and Livepatch Compatibility

Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS includes the HWE stack with the unsupported 6.11 kernel, which is incompatible with Canonical Livepatch. To ensure compatibility:

- **Recommended**: Use the Ubuntu 24.04.1 ISO, which includes the supported 6.8 kernel.
- **If Already Installed**: Manually install the 6.8 kernel and remove the HWE stack to restore Livepatch support.
